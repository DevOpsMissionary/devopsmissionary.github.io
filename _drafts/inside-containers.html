<p>One of the recent changes in technology is containers.  From a DevOps context, they enable packaging of applications and dependencies into a nice package that can be easily distributed.  Containers can also be combined within orchestration tooling to build larger applications and platforms.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to package a set of applications into an easy to use environment.  Consider a development environment that needs specific versions of the build tools.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to demonstrate one method of packaging applications into a container while enabling usage an interaction from your laptop.</p>
<p>I'm going to use the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual Box</a> - provides the ability to run a virtual machine locally.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vagrant</a> - provides automation and management of virtual machine images.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform</a> - enables provisioning and management of infrastructure across multiple cloud and server providers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ansible</a> -  enables automation of all kinds of things.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
