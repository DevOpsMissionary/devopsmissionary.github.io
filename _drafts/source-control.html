<p>When I think about DevOps and where to begin, I look at the source.  Source is like water. Having clear control and tracking of source code changes is like having clean water. It is a assumption that feeds into so many aspects of DevOps.</p>
<p>There are many different source control management (SCM) tools.  The most popular is Git.  The purpose of this post is not to go into a comparison of SCM tools, the purpose is to emphasis the importance that they are in use.</p>
