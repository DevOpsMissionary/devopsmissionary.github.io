<p>What is a DevOps Missionary?  Given the combination of DevOps and Missionary, it is expected that people would have misunderstandings about the purpose.</p>
<p>I'll start with missionary as I think it is easier.  Simply speaking a missionary is someone dedicated to a mission.  Most organizations publicly display their mission and expect their employees or members to rally around the common goals.  Historically the term missionary has been associated with religion and the process of converting people to follow specific beliefs.  This has been such a strong association (and a negative one) that traditional missionaries are preferring to be called international workers.  I prefer to look at a missionary as someone dedicated to helping others to improve their lives.  In the traditional Christian sense, that includes telling others about the grace of God and the offer of salvation through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  In other circles, it might mean helping communities get access to clean water and better hygiene.  In the context of DevOps, a DevOps missionary should be someone that helps communities adopt a culture of DevOps.</p>
<p>DevOps is an often confused term.  So much so that I try to avoid it when I describe what I do.  Instead I'll use phrases like "I train development on operational techniques and train operations on development techniques with the goal of enabling them to better work together."  People often recognize that as DevOps, but there are so many concepts sold as "DevOps" that I don't want to get misunderstood by the simple answer of "I do DevOps." So why do we put DevOps with the term missionary?  DevOps has a number of similarities with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religion</a>.  It requires changes in behavior and practice that change the culture of an organization.</p>
<p>I am not the first to use the term DevOps Missionary.  I found several references where <a href="https://twitter.com/vparihar?lang=en">Vivek Parihar</a> included DevOps Missionary in his <a href="http://www.devops-summit.org/agenda/popup/p3339">biography</a>.  There is also a related and more common term: DevOps Evangelist.  LinkedIn even has a list of the top 25 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/title/devops-evangelist">DevOps Evangelists</a>.  The relationship is similar where these people travel from group to group and preach the benefits of the culture and practice of DevOps.  However, some organizations need more than someone coming in and preaching.  They need someone that is willing to come in and spend years learning the existing culture and working with the teams to truly transform the believes and practice around software development.</p>
<p>The goal of this site is to provide support for DevOps missionaries to share ideas, techniques, and encouragement to continue the cultural transformation that will improve the way organizations develop and operate software.</p>
