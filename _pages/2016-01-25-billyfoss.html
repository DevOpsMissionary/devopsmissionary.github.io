<p>I am the creator of DevOpsMissionary.com.  While I currently work at CA Technologies, this site is my personal thoughts and ideas and are not endorsed by CA Technologies.</p>
<p>I have experience in development, test automation, build and release management, and continuous integration that spans from my time at CA Technologies, IBM, Sensus, and the Institute for Simulation and Training at the University of Central Florida.  For more details, consult <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billyfoss">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>I am also a sinner saved by the grace of God through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. While I have never traveled overseas to share the gospel, I have a number of friends that have.</p>
<p>Over the past year, I have noticed more and more similarities between their role and my own.  They spend years learning the language and building trust to be able to share the gospel.  This can also happen when moving to a new company.  There are new acronyms, new terminology, and new people of influence with which to develop relationship and build trust.  So this site came out of that recognition.  Just as missionaries across the globe need support, prayer, and encouragement, those of us transforming development and operational culture need the support.</p>
