I am the founder of DevOpsMissionary.com.

This site is a combination of my personal thoughts and opinions and those of contributors.  These are not endorsed by any current or former employers.

I have experience in development, test automation, build and release management, and continuous integration that spans from my time at Broadcom, CA Technologies, IBM, Sensus, and the Institute for Simulation and Training at the University of Central Florida. For more details, consult LinkedIn. I am also a sinner saved by the grace of God through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. While I have never traveled overseas to share the gospel, I have a number of friends that have.
Over the years, I have noticed more and more similarities between their role and my own. They spend years learning the language and building trust to be able to share the gospel. This can also happen when moving to a new company. There are new acronyms, new terminology, and new people of influence with which to develop relationship and build trust. So this site came out of that recognition. Just as missionaries across the globe need support, prayer, and encouragement, those of us transforming development and operational culture need support.
