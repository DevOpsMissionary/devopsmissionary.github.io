I have great respect for Chris Short who manages a newsletter Devops’ish

I’d like to focus on the same model People, Process, and Tools, I’ll cover them in reverse order.

## Tools
While Tools are important, there are many tools that server the same or similar purposes.  There are a number of key brands in the space and even more arising.  The key is getting a tool that works with your current processes and will enable improvements over time.

## Process
Understanding the current processes is key in any transformation.  I’ve seen too many cases of new architectures being developed and not understanding the basis user requirements. If the architecture can be updated to address these, it often comes in late and not working quite the way it was intended.  In the worst case, the effort for rearchitect takes too long to achieve parity with the previous system and ends up being replaced.

When evaluating DevOps processes, we want to look at how current processes are working and look for ways to improve incrementally. The ability to change will be hugely dependent on the people involved.

While some have looked at DevOps transformations as the key to improved speed, quality, and profits, my focus has been on improving the lives of the people involved.  If we improve various metrics on the product, but have made the lives of those involved miserable, I would argue that we have not improved the right metric.

## People
People are key to understanding DevOps principles.
